<h1>Laravel Jmeter reports</h1>
<p>Using jmeter test plan, upload your test results to a Mysql database for storeage. The front end will automatically run simple analysis and clearly outline the outcomes of the tests. It automatically links all your tests runs to the respective projects.  
    
<p>The original architecture was to have two views.</p>
<p>1. For the guys who only want a quick glance of the product quality.</p>
- this view shows anly the latest test results for a product.</p>
<p>2. The other for the test engineer who wants a closer look at their test outcomes.
- Shows the full list of test runs, and the user chooses whatever results they want to analyze.
