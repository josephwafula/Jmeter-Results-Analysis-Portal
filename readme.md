<h1>Laravel Jmeter reports</h1>
<p>Using jmeter test plan, upload your test results to a Mysql database for storeage. The front end will automatically run simple analysis and graph the outcomes of the tests. It automatically links all your tests runs to the respective projects.  
    
<p>The original architecture has two views.</p>
<p>1. For the guys who only want a quick glance of the quality of the product.</p>
- this view shows anly the latest test results for a product.</p>
<p>2. The other for the test engineer who wants to see the details of test outcomes.
